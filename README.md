2. Run backend  
You can choose to run backend locally or host backend on online services such as AWS GCP and AZURE.  
The instructions below are only for running backend on local host.  
If you finish instruction 1.1 your backend is about to run.
    ```
    cd backend\src
    node server.js
    ```

3. Run the app  
    - 3.1 Get IP address (skip this if your backend is run on web servers)  
    For Windows: open terminal and input "ipconfig"  
    Fro Max: open terminal and type "ifconfig |grep inet"  
    IP address is for connectting your app with backend.    
    - 3.2 update file  
    Then, update file GuardianNewsApiCall.java and GoogleTrendsApiCall.java with your backend url.  
    If run backend locally, backend url should be "http://" + your ip address + ":" + port_number. I set port number to 3000 in backend code.
    - 3.3 start app  
    In Android Studio, create a virtual device and run the app.
